# Coke and Code Rune Games

Here's some games I wrote on the Rune (https://rune.ai) platform because its interesting and fun. They're not examples of stellar coding, but get to the point quick with simple fun controls.

* Dungeons of Glee - https://github.com/kevglass/rune-dungeonofglee
* Go Dungeon Go - https://github.com/kevglass/rune-godungeongo
* Boing Boing - https://github.com/kevglass/rune-boingboing
* Scorched Turf - https://github.com/kevglass/rune-scorchedturf
* Flick Footie - https://github.com/kevglass/rune-flickfootie

The later games use some common code that I've put together, TOGL - Tiny Open Game Library

* TOGL - https://github.com/kevglass/togl

The sources for the games assume you've cloned TOGL in the same directory as you cloned the game. So, the package.json path to the local module as `../togl`
